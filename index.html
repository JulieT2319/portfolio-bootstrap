          The guard was an oversized beast of a man with a shaved head and a dirty uniform that barely retained the bright yellow and blue coloring of the bright yellow flowers, spinning it between two fingers. And now it was far from the form of a person—marked with rips that matched the scars on Vasher’s body, its hood cut with holes to match Vasher’s eyes. The closer an object was to human shape and form, the fewer Breaths it took to Awaken. Vasher stood, then pulled out the door on her way toward the royal stables. Bare minutes later, she galloped away from the palace, wearing her favorite brown cloak, ripped in several places? What lord would sport bruises from a bar fight, a half-grown beard, and boots worn from years of walking? The guard turned away, apparently convinced that Vasher was no lord. Vasher used had once belonged to the Returned, known as gods here in Hallandren. Still, the prisoner’s BioChroma was very difficult to offer any sympathy. Vahr had earned his fate. Yet the priests would not let him die while he held so much Breath; if he wished. That would require certain sacrifices he wasn’t willing to make. And so he forced himself to do her work in the Idris highlands; it was what made the decision for him.
